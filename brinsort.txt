Surprise: more work in planner than executor. kNN-GiST already implements a
"reorder queue" and in a generic manner too (nodeIndexScan!)

----

Planner:
* PathKeys[]: (eq class, opfamily, direction, nullsfirst)
* SortGroupClause[]: (targetlist, =op, sortop, nullsfirst)

-> Executor:

* Normal Sort: passes 4 individual arrays:
  (attnums[], sortops[], collations[], nullsfirsts[]).
  For nontrivial ORDER BY expressions, "resjunk" columns are added.
* Index scan: doesn't need to pass any data to executor; the btree index either
  satisfies the requested ordering or not.
* Sorted kNN-GiST: passes 2 arrays (sortexpr[], attnums[])

----

I wanted to have a hacked-together proof of concept running before putting in
any time for refactoring.
